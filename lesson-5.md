## Code Examples

### Pointers Basics Examples

**Pointer Declaration and Initialization:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    int *ptr; // Pointer declaration
    ptr = &num; // Pointer initialization
    printf("Value: %d\n", *ptr); // Dereferencing pointer
    return 0;
}
```

### Pointer Arithmetic Examples

**Pointer Arithmetic:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *ptr = arr; // Pointer initialization
    printf("Element 2: %d\n", *(ptr + 1)); // Accessing array element
    return 0;
}
```

### Pointers and Arrays Examples

**Using Pointers to Access Array Elements:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
    int *ptr = arr; // Pointer initialization
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Element %d: %d\n", i, *(ptr + i)); // Accessing array element
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Multi-dimensional Arrays Examples

**Accessing 2D Array Elements Using Pointers:**
{% highlight c %}
{% raw %}
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int matrix[3][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};
    int *ptr = &matrix[0][0]; // Pointer initialization
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            printf("%d ", *(ptr + i * 3 + j)); // Accessing 2D array element
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Strings and Pointers Examples

**Using Pointers to Manipulate Strings:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char str[] = "Hello, world!";
    char *ptr = str; // Pointer initialization
    while (*ptr != '\0') {
        printf("%c", *ptr); // Printing characters using pointer
        ptr++;
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```
